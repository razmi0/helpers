    { message: "success" }, // ReturnType<onSuccess>
    { message: "failed" }, // ReturnType<onError>
    string, // ReturnType<before>
    string // ReturnType<after>
>("<https://example.com>", {
    onSuccess: (response, data) => [response, data], //  in the 200-299 range
    onError: (response, data) => [response, data], // in the >= 300 range
    before: () => "Hello before ", // before the request is sent
    after: (before) => `${before} and hello after`, // after the request is completed
});
```

It follow :

```text
